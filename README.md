# Disaster Response Pipeline 
This project consists of creating ETL and ML pipelines responsible of calssifying text messages received in the occurence of disasters, and then deploying the model into a flask web application.


## Libraries
1. Pandas     
2. sys     
3. sklearn     
4. pickle     
5. re     
6. nltk     
7. sqlalchemy     


## Project's Purpose
When disasters occur, organizations responsible of dealing and helping victims face a big challenge in addressing everybody's concerns and fears. Hence, in a way to improve those organizations' operations and eliminate any distractions, this model is basicaly an ETL and ML pipelines responsible of preprocessing text dara, loading them onto a SQL database which will be then used to train our model using the ML pipeline. This model will have access to it from a Flask Web App.
